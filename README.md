fchat-pidgin
------------

Pidgin plugin for using FList's chat. Forked from TestPanther's version over at https://code.google.com/p/flist-pidgin/

Cross Compilation
-----------------

contrib/cross_compile.sh fetches and compiles pidgin for Windows under Linux, using mingw. At the moment, NSS isn't compiled, so secure connections are not available.
